[CI/CD](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment) automates validation. Small changes. Fast feedback. Deploy often. The system proves it works, not you.

Principles: measure automatically, get results fast, iterate immediately.

Where else could this work in life?
