My absolutely favourite note in music is Rest (silent note), not a Jazz [#iv/V7](https://pianowithjonny.com/piano-lessons/the-most-beautiful-jazz-piano-chord/). Use [silence in conversation](https://www.vinhgiang.com/how-to-stop-saying-um/) too, show the intentional touch of what you speak, and allow audience to ponder and feel it.
