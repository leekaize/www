The script is predictable.

Wait for the prompt. React. Follow the predetermined path. Do the pre-programmed actions.

That’s the game of the Non-Player Character. It’s safe, it’s easy, and it’s not your story.

The alternative is to be the protagonist.

The protagonist owns the narrative. They decide which quests to ignore. They set the boundaries. They cut out the side-plots that drain their energy. This isn't about hogging the spotlight. It's about intention.

And the paradox? The best protagonists know it’s not a single-player game. Every other person on the screen is the hero of their own story.

True humility isn’t thinking less of your character; it’s being deeply invested in the larger world you inhabit.

The world doesn't need another NPC.

It’s waiting for your story to unfold.
