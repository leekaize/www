The costume doesn't fit.

It's heavy. Itchy. It isn't you.

And when the world whispers that you're in the wrong story, the instinct is to double down. To prove the costume fits. To ignore the overwhelming evidence that itâ€™s time for a change.

This is the trap of the misfit. A loop of proactive avoidance.

For a decade, the answer seemed to be goals.
"Run a marathon."
"Finish the project."
"Win the game."

But goals are about the finish line. They don't change who you are during the race. They are a temporary destination, not a new way of being. The real trap is thinking that an achievement will somehow fix the person achieving it.

It won't.

The real shift isn't resolving to *do* something.
It's deciding to *be* someone.

Stop saying, "I want to run."
Start saying, "You are a runner."

Stop chasing the next goal.
Start embodying a new identity.

Take off the costume. The real story is waiting.
