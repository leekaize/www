To my family, friends, and everyone I’ve hurt, disappointed, or ghosted over the past decade: I’m sorry. I’m sorry my depression made you feel abandoned or confused. It wasn’t your fault—I was fighting a battle I didn’t know how to explain.

But this isn’t a letter of sorrow—it’s one of joy. Real change happened, and it’s worth sharing: for those who need hope, and for those who’ve wondered what I was going through.

The core issue was **cognitive dissonance**. I spent a decade trying to wear skins that weren’t mine. I forced myself into roles—son, friend, professional—with specific traits that others projected onto me. Only recently—through deeper conversations with colleagues and friends of different races, ethnicities, and personalities—did it become clear: people have wildly different callings in life. **What one person dreams of, another is desperate to escape**.

I learned resilience and humility from my parents—two of the most vital attitudes anyone can have. But I also got myself stuck in a rather narrow worldview, without exploring who I am. Not that I blame them—survival demanded their mindset. But survival isn’t living.

Breaking free took courage. I had to dismantle the cages I built for myself: from others’ expectations, and from my own distorted perception. As James Clear writes in Atomic Habits, real change comes from identity shift, not empty resolutions like "I’ll run a marathon" or "I'll try to run daily." For a decade, **I failed by chasing goals, not becoming someone new**.

The shift was simple, just say: "I am a runner. Period." Same goes for everything else in life. It’s not "fake it till you make it."; It’s **imagine it, then be it**.

> Mind is the forerunner of all states. — Dhammapada 1.1

Yes, the mind shapes reality. But Buddhism also warns: clinging to identity is suffering. These shifts aren’t just about labels—they’re about hacking your habits towards more and more fundamental identity of us over time until virtue becomes automatic.

> ...virtue is a habit which is always referred to good. — Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologiae I-II Q55 A4](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/2055.htm)

I’m not "fixed", I’m free now. I ditched affiliations, dogmas, and the need to be "someone." As an ENTP, I thrive in neutrality—not indifference, but radical curiosity about the world without filters.

The antidote to my depression? Becoming who I am. Not who you wanted. Not who society demanded. My unique calling is no longer a job title—it’s the fire in my bones when I wake up. Imposter syndrome died the day I stopped apologizing for existing. Now? Every day is a playground!
