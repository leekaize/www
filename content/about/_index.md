I am Lee Kai Ze. Majored in Mechatronics Engineering and worked as System Integrator. Currently focusing on improving the Industry 4.0 landscape, bringing value to both clients and engineers by pushing the technology forward.

### I believe:

1. We should be deeply invested in the world and practice humility. Not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.
2. We should be pragmatic and work on things that bring the [biggest impact](https://80000hours.org/) in your circumstances. Not the most idealistic fantasies, perfectionalism leads to no progress.
3. Whatever is your beliefs or religion, we should live our days upon prayer. Praying is not for you to ask something from God, it is our channel to get in touch with the existence of universe. Pray for the greater good of the world, listen attentively, and align every single action of your day towards it.
4. Affiliation is often meaningless, and [debates should be prevented](https://leekaize.com/blog/stop-debating-start-building). Build everything upon first principle thinkings.
