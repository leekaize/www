I am Lee Kai Ze.

Studied Mechatronics Engineering and worked as System Integrator. Currently focusing on improving the Industry 4.0 landscape, bringing value to both clients and engineers by pushing the technology forward.

### I believe:

1. We should be deeply invested in the world and practice humility. Not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.
2. We should [be pragmatic](https://leekaize.com/blog/be-pragmatic/) to bring the [biggest impact](https://80000hours.org/) in our circumstances. Ideological perfectionism leads to no progress.
3. We should live our days upon prayer, not to ask something from God, but to get in touch with the existence of universe. Pray for the greater good of the world, listen attentively, and align every single action of your day towards it.
4. Affiliation is often meaningless, and [debates should be prevented](https://leekaize.com/blog/stop-debating-start-building). Build everything upon first principle thinkings.
